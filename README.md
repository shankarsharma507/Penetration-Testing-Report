## üîç Key Findings & Vulnerability Summary

[cite_start]The assessment identified several vulnerabilities, with severity ratings assigned based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS v3.1)[cite: 52, 82].

| OWASP Category (2021) | Severity | Description / Observation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A06: Vulnerable & Outdated Components** | High | [cite_start]Outdated Astra theme and end-of-life PHP 7.4 were identified, posing a high risk of remote code execution or data breach[cite: 87, 325, 326]. |
| **A03: Injection** | Medium | [cite_start]The login form showed response anomalies suggesting it may be vulnerable to SQL injection, potentially leading to data exfiltration[cite: 87]. |
| **A04: Insecure Design** | Medium | [cite_start]The application lacks MFA, CAPTCHA, and account lockout policies, making it susceptible to brute-force and credential stuffing attacks[cite: 87, 235, 236]. |
| **A07: Identification & Authentication Failures** | Medium | [cite_start]No brute-force prevention or strong password policies were enforced, increasing account takeover risk[cite: 87]. |
| **A08: Software & Data Integrity Failures** | Medium | [cite_start]The absence of integrity verification for plugins and themes could lead to supply chain attacks or backdoors[cite: 87]. |
| **A05: Security Misconfiguration** | Low | [cite_start]While no sensitive data was exposed, some server responses could aid attackers in future attempts[cite: 87]. |
| **A02: Cryptographic Failures** | Low | [cite_start]The application correctly enforces HTTPS and strong TLS protocols (TLS 1.2/1.3), posing minimal risk[cite: 87, 167]. |
